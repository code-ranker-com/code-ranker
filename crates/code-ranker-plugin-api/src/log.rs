//! Shared stderr progress/timing log.
//!
//! This lives in the foundation crate so every component — CLI stages and the
//! sub-commands plugins shell out to (`git`, `cargo metadata`, `rustc`) — emits
//! one consistent line format. All output goes to **stderr** (machine output and
//! artifacts go to stdout/files), prefixed with a local `HH:MM:SS.mmm` stamp.
//! Durations are printed to **millisecond precision** (`0.231s`).
//!
//! How loud that stream is is governed by a single process-wide [verbosity
//! level](set_level), set once at startup from `--output.mode`. The level lives
//! here (not in the CLI) because the lines it gates are emitted from both the CLI
//! stages and the plugins — they share one switch. Emitters come in three tiers:
//! [`line`] always prints (errors); [`summary`] prints at `SUMMARY`+ (the closing
//! `✓` line, warnings, written-artifact paths); [`verbose`]/[`subcmd`] print only
//! at `VERBOSE` (the `▶`/`config:` startup lines and every external-tool timing).
