# code-ranker — AI agent skill

A short playbook for an AI assistant driving `code-ranker`. Full flag reference:
[CLI.md](code-ranker-cli/CLI.md); metrics and rules: [ERRORS.md](code-ranker-cli/ERRORS.md);
copy-paste recipes (one command per scenario): [USE-CASES.md](code-ranker-cli/USE-CASES.md).

## Install

If a `code-ranker` command errors with "command not found" (the binary isn't
installed), install it via the channel that matches the project's existing
toolchain — reuse what the user already has rather than introducing a new one:

```sh
cargo install code-ranker     # Rust project (Cargo on PATH)
npm install -g code-ranker    # web / JS / TS project (npm on PATH)
pip install code-ranker       # Python project (pip / uv / pipx)
```

All channels ship the same binary. Full guide (universal shell installer, Docker,
platform notes): [installation.md](installation.md).

## Two commands

- **`check`** — a gate. Exits non-zero on a violation, writes no files.
- **`report`** — produces artifacts: a JSON snapshot, an HTML viewer, and the
  advisory **`scorecard`** (console triage) / **`prompt`** (LLM prompt). Always
  exits `0`.
- **`docs <subject>`** — prints a reference doc to the terminal (no analysis; always
  exits `0`). Run `code-ranker docs ai` to bootstrap this playbook: with a language
  resolved it prints the full playbook + principle/metric catalog; with none
  (no markers) it prints a brief intro and how to select one.

`[input]` is polymorphic: a directory is analyzed; a `.json` snapshot is read
back with no re-analysis. Keep old `.code-ranker/` snapshots — they are baselines.

`check` / `report` analyze **all** languages auto-detected from project markers and
produce one report covering every language — a directory with markers for several
(e.g. Rust + Markdown) just analyzes both, no error. To pin the set explicitly, pass
`--plugins <a,b,...>` or set `plugins = [...]` in a `code-ranker.toml` at the project
root. When a `--prompt <ID>` or `--focus` resolves in two or more languages, add
`--language <name>` to pick which one to focus.

## The two metrics that matter

Focus on these; treat everything else as secondary.

- **ADP** — dependency cycles. A module graph should be acyclic.
- **HK** — Henry-Kafura coupling, `HK = sloc × (fan_in × fan_out)²`: a large
  module on a busy crossroads of incoming/outgoing dependencies. Full
  diagnose-and-split workflow (measure one file, list its fan_in/fan_out, find
  the mixed scenarios, split, verify with a before/after diff report): run
  `code-ranker docs HK` (prints the full principle to the terminal, offline).

**Strategy:** fix one thing at a time, worst-first. Cycles (ADP) are structural —
clear them first; then coupling (HK). Focus on one metric or principle with `--focus` and inspect
the worst tier with `--severity warning`.

## The fix loop

One thing per pass, worst-first.

```sh
# 1. Find what to fix. The gate verdict:
code-ranker check .
#    …or focus one metric or principle in the triage (cycle = ADP, then hk, sloc, cognitive, …):
code-ranker report . --output.scorecard --focus cycle --top 1

# 2. Get the actionable fix-prompt for the single worst module (auto-targeted):
code-ranker report . --output.prompt.path=stdout --top 1
#    …or get a focused fix-prompt directly (metric- or principle-framed):
code-ranker report . --output.prompt.path=stdout --focus hk --top 1

# 3. Review it; propose the fix to the user and get agreement.

# 4. Snapshot the BEFORE state:
code-ranker report . --output.json.path=.code-ranker/before.json

# 5. Apply the fix.

# 6. Run all tests.

# 7. Render the before/after report and open it:
code-ranker report . --baseline .code-ranker/before.json \
  --output.json.path=.code-ranker/after.json \
  --output.html.path=.code-ranker/after.html
open .code-ranker/after.html          # macOS; xdg-open on Linux

# 8. Repeat until clean.
```

Notes:

- `--output.prompt` **requires `--top 1`**. Without `--focus` it is **auto-targeted**
  at the single worst module of the worst-violating principle; add `--focus` to pick
  the focus yourself (see the next note).
- To focus a specific metric or principle, narrow the triage with `--output.scorecard --focus <name>`:
  a **metric** (`cycle`, `hk`, `sloc`, `cognitive`, `cyclomatic`, `fan_in`, `fan_out`,
  `items` — also accepts the full rule id, e.g. `threshold.file.hk`) or a **principle** id
  (`LSP`, `SRP`, `OCP`, …). `--focus` also applies to
  `--output.prompt`: `--focus hk --output.prompt.path=stdout --top 1` emits a
  **metric-framed** fix-prompt directly (titled "HK — Henry–Kafura", no Liskov wrapper),
  while `--focus <PRINCIPLE>` emits a **principle-framed** one. Without `--focus`, the
  prompt auto-targets the worst-violating principle.
- To scope the ranking to a subtree, add `--focus-path <dir>` (repeatable): the whole
  project is still analyzed, but only modules under those repo-relative paths are
  ranked/listed (a folder matches everything beneath it). Combine with `--focus` to
  intersect; cycles stay global (they are not narrowed by `--focus-path`).
- For `--focus cycle`, `--top 1` shows **one whole cycle** — the biggest `chain`
  (else the biggest `mutual`) — with **all** its modules listed, so you can fix the
  loop as a unit.

## Agent gate loop

One command gates **and** emits the fix-prompt — no `||`, no second command. With
`--output-format prompt`, `check` exits non-zero on a violation and prints the AI
fix-prompt for **exactly the violations that failed the gate**:

```sh
code-ranker check . --output-format prompt
# exit 0  → no violations, the agent stops
# exit≠0  → stdout is the fix-prompt; hand it to the agent, it fixes, you re-run
```

The prompt is built from the gate's own violations (the thresholds in `code-ranker.toml`),
so it always describes what actually failed — no separate principle selection, no
threshold mismatch.

## Cheat sheet

```sh
code-ranker report . --output.scorecard                       # triage: all principles
code-ranker report . --output.scorecard --focus hk --top 1    # focus one metric or principle
code-ranker report . --output.prompt.path=stdout --top 1      # LLM fix-prompt for the worst module
code-ranker check  . --baseline base.json --output-format json   # CI regression verdict
```

## Gotchas

- Analysis is offline and fast. The Rust plugin needs a warm cargo cache
  (`cargo metadata --offline`); if it errors, run `cargo fetch` first.
- `--focus` / `--focus-path` / `--severity` / `--top` are **report-only** — they
  require a `--output.prompt` or `--output.scorecard`, else the run errors.
- `--output.prompt` **requires `--top 1`** — it is auto-targeted at the single worst
  module. For a broader view use `--output.scorecard`.
- `--top N` is a reporting limit (`--top 1` = the single worst); use it instead
  of a non-existent `--index`.
- Don't delete `.code-ranker/` snapshots — they are your baselines for diffs.
