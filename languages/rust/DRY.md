# DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself (in Rust)

**TL;DR**: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
authoritative representation within a system. DRY is about **knowledge
duplication**, not **code duplication** — copy-pasted lines that
encode different decisions are not DRY violations; one line in two
different modules that means "the maximum retry count" is.

## In Rust

Rust has several mechanisms that make true DRY clean and several
that make false DRY tempting. Use the first set; resist the second.

### Mechanisms for genuine DRY

**Constants and statics**:

```rust
pub const MIN_ALCOHOL_AGE: u8 = 18;
pub const MAX_USERNAME_LEN: usize = 64;
pub const PASSWORD_RESET_TTL: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60 * 15);
```

One canonical place. The compiler will not let you misspell
`MIN_ALCOHOL_AGE` — typos become compile errors.

**Functions that name a calculation**:

```rust
pub fn effective_tax_rate(subtotal: Money, jurisdiction: &Jurisdiction) -> Rate {
    base_rate(jurisdiction) + surcharge_for(subtotal)
}
```

The formula has one expression. If the regulation changes, you
change one place.

**Generic functions for true polymorphism**:

```rust
pub fn parse_id<T: From<Uuid>>(s: &str) -> Result<T> {
    Uuid::parse_str(s).map(T::from).map_err(...)
}
```

Used to derive `UserId`, `OrderId`, `TransactionId` from the same
parsing logic — *which is genuinely the same knowledge*.

**Macros for textual repetition with knowledge content**:

```rust
macro_rules! impl_id_newtype {
    ($name:ident) => {
        #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
        pub struct $name(Uuid);
        impl $name {
            pub fn new() -> Self { Self(Uuid::new_v4()) }
            pub fn as_uuid(&self) -> &Uuid { &self.0 }
        }
        impl From<Uuid> for $name { fn from(u: Uuid) -> Self { Self(u) } }
    };
}

impl_id_newtype!(UserId);
impl_id_newtype!(OrderId);
impl_id_newtype!(TransactionId);
```

The macro encodes the **decision** "all IDs are UUIDs with this
exact shape". If the decision changes (say, to ULIDs), one
modification updates all newtypes.

**Derive macros for cross-cutting concerns**:

`#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize)]` codifies "every domain type
gets these capabilities" once, in `serde_derive`. You do not
re-implement `Debug` for every struct.

**Type aliases for shared shapes**:

```rust
pub type ConfigResult<T> = Result<T, ConfigError>;
```

The fact that "config operations return `Result<_, ConfigError>`"
appears once.

### Mechanisms that *tempt* false DRY

**Over-eager helper extraction**:

```rust
fn validate_user_input(s: &str) -> bool { s.len() > 0 && s.len() < 100 && !s.contains('\0') }
fn validate_order_note(s: &str) -> bool { s.len() > 0 && s.len() < 100 && !s.contains('\0') }
```

Tempting to extract `fn validate_short_text(s: &str) -> bool`. But
the two validations *happen* to coincide today. Tomorrow the order
note rule changes to "≤ 500 chars" and now the helper grows a
parameter, a boolean flag, two enum variants, etc.

Better: leave them duplicated until the third copy appears. Hunt:
"Rule of Three" — abstract when you have *three* concrete instances
proving the abstraction is real, not two.

**Premature shared crate**:

Workspaces accumulate a `crates/common/` or `crates/utils/` that
becomes a junk drawer of weakly-related helpers. The crate's "DRY"
benefit is illusory — the helpers were never the same knowledge,
just the same shape.

Better: leave the local helpers local. If three crates genuinely
need the same calculation, extract *that calculation*, not "stuff
the three crates might share".

**Forcing identical APIs onto different abstractions**:

```rust
trait Storage {
    fn put(&self, k: &str, v: &[u8]);
    fn get(&self, k: &str) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;
}
impl Storage for HashMap<String, Vec<u8>> { /* ... */ }
impl Storage for S3Client { /* ... */ }
```

Memory and S3 do not share a contract (see
[LSP](LSP.md)). The shared trait is a
DRY-shaped illusion masking incompatible behaviours.

## Violations and remedies

### Anti-pattern: magic numbers duplicated

```rust
// crates/api/src/handlers/auth.rs
if username.len() > 64 { return Err(ApiError::TooLong); }

// crates/domain/src/user.rs
if request.name.len() > 64 { return Err(DomainError::Invalid); }

// crates/admin/src/forms.rs
fn validate(s: &str) -> bool { s.len() <= 64 }
```

If the limit changes, three places must be edited and someone will
miss the third.

### Idiomatic fix: single source of truth in a domain crate

```rust
// crates/domain/src/limits.rs
pub const MAX_USERNAME_LEN: usize = 64;
```

```rust
// everywhere else
use domain::limits::MAX_USERNAME_LEN;
if username.len() > MAX_USERNAME_LEN { ... }
```

### Anti-pattern: duplicated SQL schema knowledge

```rust
// crates/repo/src/users.rs
const COLS: &str = "id, email, name, created_at, deleted_at";

fn fetch(...) -> ... {
    sqlx::query("SELECT id, email, name, created_at, deleted_at FROM users WHERE id = $1")...
}
fn insert(...) -> ... {
    sqlx::query("INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, created_at) VALUES ...")...
}
```

The column list appears three times (in `COLS`, in the SELECT, in
the INSERT). Adding a column requires updating each.

### Idiomatic fix: an ORM-style entity or a `sqlx::FromRow` derive

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct UserRow {
    id: Uuid,
    email: String,
    name: String,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    deleted_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}

const COLS: &str = "id, email, name, created_at, deleted_at";

fn fetch(id: Uuid) -> Result<UserRow> {
    sqlx::query_as::<_, UserRow>(&format!("SELECT {COLS} FROM users WHERE id = $1"))
        .bind(id).fetch_one(&pool).await
}
```

Adding a column means: add a field to `UserRow`, add a name to
`COLS`. Two edits, both in the same file.

### Anti-pattern: parallel validation in API and domain

```rust
// crates/api/src/handlers/orders.rs
pub fn create_order_handler(req: CreateOrderRequest) -> impl Reply {
    if req.items.is_empty() { return reject("no items"); }
    if req.total < Money::ZERO { return reject("negative total"); }
    // ... 12 more checks ...
}

// crates/domain/src/order.rs
impl Order {
    pub fn new(items: Vec<Item>, total: Money) -> Result<Self> {
        if items.is_empty() { return Err(...); }
        if total < Money::ZERO { return Err(...); }
        // ... 12 more checks ...
    }
}
```

Every validation rule exists twice. They drift.

### Idiomatic fix: validation lives in the domain; API delegates

```rust
// crates/domain/src/order.rs
impl Order {
    pub fn new(items: Vec<Item>, total: Money) -> Result<Self, DomainError> {
        if items.is_empty() { return Err(DomainError::NoItems); }
        if total < Money::ZERO { return Err(DomainError::NegativeTotal); }
        // ...
    }
}
```

```rust
// crates/api/src/handlers/orders.rs
pub fn create_order_handler(req: CreateOrderRequest) -> impl Reply {
    let order = match Order::new(req.items, req.total) {
        Ok(o) => o,
        Err(e) => return reject(e),
    };
    // ...
}
```

The API performs *no business validation*. It translates errors. A
new rule is added in one place — in the domain.

### Anti-pattern: copy-pasted code that ISN'T DRY

```rust
fn calculate_tax_us(amount: Money) -> Money { amount * 0.07 }
fn calculate_tax_eu(amount: Money) -> Money { amount * 0.21 }
fn calculate_tax_uk(amount: Money) -> Money { amount * 0.20 }
```

It would be tempting to extract `fn calculate_tax(rate: f32, amount: Money)`.
Should you?

**No** — for two reasons:

1. The three tax rates are not the same knowledge. They are
   independent regulations. If the EU rate changes, the US rate is
   unaffected.
2. The functions communicate intent. `calculate_tax_us(amount)` reads
   better at the call site than `calculate_tax(0.07, amount)`.

When VAT rates split by region into 27 individual values that vary
together (per EU directive), THEN extract. The Rule of Three applies.

### Idiomatic fix: leave as-is

Resist the urge. Three lookups in a table is fine. (See Sandi Metz,
"The Wrong Abstraction".)

## DRY at the crate level

Cross-crate DRY shows up as:

- A constant duplicated in multiple `Cargo.toml`s (e.g. `version`).
  Fix: workspace inheritance (`version.workspace = true`).
- A type duplicated across crates because both need "the same" struct
  shape. Fix: one defining crate, the others depend on it. (Or
  *don't fix* if the two structs happen to look alike but mean
  different things.)
- A dependency version pinned in multiple `Cargo.toml`s. Fix:
  `[workspace.dependencies]` declares once.

## How code-ranker detects DRY violations

DRY is the hardest principle to detect automatically — knowledge
duplication does not have a graph signature. Code Ranker can flag
*candidates*:

| Signal | DRY interpretation |
|---|---|
| Identical function names across multiple modules (e.g. `validate`, `parse`, `format`) | Possible knowledge duplication. Requires fn-name overlap analysis. |
| Public constants with identical *values* across multiple crates | Strong DRY-violation candidate. Requires AST inspection. |
| Multiple crates with similar Cargo.toml dependency lists | Possibly the same domain repeated. |
| Repeated string-literal regex patterns | Regex literals appearing in N source files is a textbook DRY violation. |

Code Ranker's static graph cannot tell you whether two functions
*encode the same knowledge* — that requires understanding the
function bodies. A future rule could flag literal duplication and
let the LLM-verification step (see `cpt-code-ranker-fr-prompt-composer`)
decide.

## Suggested recommendation template
